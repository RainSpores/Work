In vitro

Growth rate of pathogen calculated by measuring the increase in surface area of the colony 

Â½ PDA 



PCR-DGGE showed that vermicompost maintained a consistent microbial community profile during storage. 

The results from this in vitro assay will be tested in a plant containing system to determine whether the effect on growth of the pathogen in vitro translates to reduction of disease in vivo.
