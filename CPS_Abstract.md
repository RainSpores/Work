PCR-DGGE showed that vermicompost maintained a consistent microbial community profile during storage. 

The results from this in vitro assay will be tested in a plant containing system to determine whether the effect on growth of the pathogen in vitro translates to reduction of disease in vivo.

An In-vitro assay of biocontrol efficacy with microbial background

We constructed an assay to test whether soil microorganisms would have a positive or negative effect on biological control of plant diseases. 

Vermicompost was tested using DGGE to determine whether it would provide a stable microbial inoculum, providing the same microbial communities over time. 

A background soil flora was created using aerated vermicompost tea, and a simple bioassay was conducted by inoculating FORC onto
